#Urban Pollution Trends ML

##Description
This project presents a comparative analysis of urban air pollution trends in London using advanced machine learning techniques. It employs SARIMA and LSTM models to forecast air quality levels, focusing on key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3. The study aims to provide data-driven insights for urban planning and public health policies.

##Key Features

-Implementation of SARIMA and LSTM models for air quality forecasting
-Analysis of pollution trends from 2020 onwards, accounting for COVID-19 impacts
-Evaluation of forecasts against WHO Air Quality Guidelines
-Visualization of pollution trends and model predictions

##Data Source
The project utilizes data from the UK Air quality data archive, managed by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra).

##Models

-SARIMA (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks

##Results

-Forecasts for PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 levels in London
-Comparative analysis of model performance
-Assessment of predicted pollution levels against WHO guidelines

##Future Directions

-Expansion to include more cities for a global perspective
-Integration of real-time data feeds
-Exploration of hybrid models combining statistical and neural network approaches

##Requirements

Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, statsmodels, keras, tensorflow, matplotlib

##Usage
[Include instructions on how to run the models and replicate the analysis]
